For this question, you are only concerned with writing the Quack.c/h file

You are given a Stack ADT. You need to write/modify the Quack ADT to act as
a queue, USING STACKS.

Quick run down of Stacks vs Queues:
{
Stacks are First In, First Out (FIFO). Imagine a stack of plates, the push
function will out the plate at the top, while pop will remove it.

Queues are First In, Last Out (FILO). This is just like a queue of people,
push will place something at the back of the line, pop will remove something
from the front.
}

You CANNOT create a new ADT, you can only use fundamental types, and whatever
is defined in the Stack.h and Quack.h
