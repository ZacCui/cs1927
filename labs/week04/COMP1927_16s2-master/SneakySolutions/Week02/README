Welcome to your first Quiz!

This works similar to labs, where you run 'make' and then 
./solution to run your program.

It should take in a list of characters from the set '{}[]()',
not in any particular order or fashion, and print "invalid"
or "valid" whether or not the string is a valid set of brackets
i.e. ([]) is valid, but ([)] is invalid, and so is (][)

I've only written basic tests in the tests folder, you need to
create 3 more cases which the basic ones do not consider. 0X.in 
should be the input for your program, and 0X.exp is what you 
expect it to output

To run tests, first go "chmod a+x run_tests", should only need
to do this once ever, then go ./run_tests
